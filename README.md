# Choice Game

# The study is conducted as part of an MSc Dissertation from the University of Warwick.

# The purpose of this study is to understand how people make choices when presented with multiple options with different monetary payoffs or costs.

# In this study, which will last for about 15-20 minutes, participants will complete a multiple-round choice game. At the beginning of each round, they will start with a certain number of tokens. They will then repeatedly choose between two options, which lead to different outcomes (gaining or losing different numbers of tokens). The number of tokens they have in the end of each round will determine their bonus payment. 

# Participants will be presented with 4 rounds consisting of 50 trials each. For each round, the screen will show two options without any descriptions. Participants are required to choose between the two options for a certain number of trials to explore the options and draw their own insights about the options. The options may indicate losses or gains which will result in the increase or decrease of the tokens the participants will accumulate during the study. The participantsâ€™ choices during the trials of the round and the response times for each round will be recorded during the study.
